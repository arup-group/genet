# Contributing

When it comes to planning in the built environment, we think transparency is critical. The shape and operations of our shared infrastructure and public spaces impacts individualsâ€™ access to employment opportunities, education, social communities, clean air, and safe mobility options. 
We think open source, agent based models are the future for transparent, granular city planning. So we built GeNet which helps to make the process of modifying and validating MATSim transport networks a little less painful. 

Thank you for considering contributing to GeNet! We're really excited to hear your opinions on the project and any ideas
you may have on how it can be better!

Please note we have a code of conduct. Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Ways to Contribute

There are a number of ways you can contribute to the project. The major two are:
- Submitting a GitHub issue. This could involve:
    - Logging a bug or undesirable behaviour
    - Recording area of possible improvement
    - Requesting a change or addition of a new feature
- Contributing code. Our work is never done, if you have an idea how you could make GeNet better or if you think you 
could generalise it:
    - You can outline the new feature or desired behaviour in a GitHub issue and send us an email on [citymodelling@arup.com](mailto:citymodelling@arup.com) 
    to let us know you're willing to work on it. We may invite you for a brief rubber-ducking session to go through 
    your idea in more detail. The aim is to mature your idea with one (or more) GeNet developers and to flag 
    any possible blocks or implementation issues to be aware of.
    - Please follow advice below on Contributing Code, working in a branch and the Pull Request process.
    - You may continue to, and are encouraged to, keep in touch and reach out to us throughout your development work.

See this helpful site on [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) for more ideas
 on how you could contribute. Get in touch with us via email [citymodelling@arup.com](mailto:citymodelling@arup.com).

## Submitting Issues

If you have an idea for an enhancement, a change or addition of new feature or behaviour for GeNet or a record of a bug 
you can communicate this to us in detail through a written account as a GitHub issue on GeNet's [issues page](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/issues).
 
A good issue will outline the problem in a full written format. It is helpful to include screenshots, especially to 
highlight any physical issues with the network. It is also helpful to include why you think the new feature would be
useful, what problem is it solving and whether there is a real-world cases study that would benefit from this 
improvement.

In case of bugs, please provide the full error message, the OS and 
information about the environment in which the process had been ran. It is also helpful to include a small 
(if possible) set of data on which the problem can be recreated---at the very least, a thorough description of the 
input data should be included.

See this page on [Creating an issue](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/issues) on GitHub to learn how to submit an 
issue.

## Contributing Code - Pull Request Process

To find beginner-friendly issues you may want to work on, look [here](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/contribute).

1. All new work is done in a branch taken from master, details can be found here:
[feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
2. Ensure your work is covered by unit tests to the required percentage level. This script 
[`bash_scripts/code-coverage.sh`](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/blob/master/bash_scripts/code-coverage.sh)
 will help both in checking that the coverage level is satisfied and investigating places in code that have not been 
 covered by the tests (via an output file `reports/coverage/index.html` which can be viewed in a browser).
3. Ensure the sample notebooks execute without error by running `./bash_scripts/notebooks-smoke-test.sh`. Problems in
the core GeNet APIs or in the notebooks themselves can both cause notebook failures.
4. Provide [docstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for new methods.
5. Perform linting locally using ```./bash_scripts/lint-check.sh```
6. Add or update dependencies in `requirements.txt` if applicable
7. Ensure the CI build pipeline (Actions tab in GitHub) completes successfully for your branch. The pipeline performs
automated `PEP8` checks and runs unit tests in a fresh environment, as well as installation of all dependencies.
8. Update/add to or generate a new jupyter notebook in `notebooks` directory which takes the user through your new feature or
change.
   1. Jupyter notebooks are closely linked to the [wiki pages](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/wiki). 
      1. Make sure you follow the naming convention: `number.number. Theme: Catchy Title`
      2. Make sure you structure the notebook in a way that you would like to see it in a wiki page, with a lot of 
      markdown cells containing quality descriptions. Use existing notebook as examples.
   2. After your changes have been merged, you may like to update the wiki pages. To do this in an automated way:
      1. Clone the wiki part of the repo: ```git clone https://github.com/arup-group/genet.wiki.git```
      2. Run the `notebooks/generate_usage_wiki_from_notebooks.py` script, pointing at the folder containing the 
      notebooks and the wiki repo folder to receive the output.
   3. You may use example data already in `example_data` directory of this repo, or add more (small amount of) data to
   it to show off your new features.
9. Add section in the `README.md` which shows usage of your new feature. This can be paraphrased from the jupyter
notebook in point above.
10. If the feature is to be used in an automated workflow through the docker image, create n example script in the 
`scripts` directory. Please use existing scripts as templates.
11. Submit your Pull Request (see [GitHub Docs on Creating a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)),
 describing the feature, linking to any relevant GitHub issues and request review from at 
least two developers. (Please take a look at latest commits to find out which developers you should request review from)
12. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
do not have permission to do that, please request one of the reviewers to merge it for you.
