MODES:
  MODE_INDICATORS:
    # These refer to tags stored in OSM, the mode assignment to tags is manual and definitely not exhaustive. The
    # tags that are not understood by puma will be logged and can be reviewed before proceeding with building the network.
    # if a tag is not listed here, it will not be read into the network. This is where you should define how dense
    # you want your network to be. If any of these tags don't have values defined for them in
    # src/outputs_handling/matsim_xml_values.py, it will default to DEFAULT_OSM_TAG_VALUE
