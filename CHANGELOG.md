# Changelog

## [v4.0.0] - 2023-08-22

### Added
* Validation for [intermodal access/egress for MATSim](https://github.com/matsim-org/matsim-libs/tree/master/contribs/sbb-extensions#intermodal-access-and-egress)
* GeNet Scripts for: [#179](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/pull/179)
  * automated PT Schedule fixing (zero headways and infinite speeds)
  * 'squeezing' (or reducing attribute values) speed and capacity on links defined by spatial boundaries 
  * scaling vehicles (separately from any other operation, so it can be performed independently)
* Script to split modal subgraphs (so they have dedicated links) [#153](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/pull/153)
* Validation checks for zero and infinite speeds PT speeds + many convenience methods [#147](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/pull/147)
* Validation checks for zero headways and reporting on PT headway stats + many convenience methods [#146](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/pull/146)
* Validation checks for isolated nodes and method to remove all isolated nodes [#143](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/pull/143)
* Validation checks for infinite and negative values of attributes for a network [#141](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/pull/141)
* Functionality to split a link at a point, creating two links which preserve original geometry [#140](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/pull/140)
* Ability to use .tif files for elevation with any projection [#139](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/pull/139)
* Summary statistics to summarise data stored for a network and schedule [#136](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/pull/136)
* Script that adds elevation can also save node attributes [#134](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/pull/134)
* Script to parse example jupyter notebook to genet wiki pages (useful if you contribute to the project) [#129](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/pull/129)

### Fixed

* Schema breaking for nested lists (representing trips information, for example) when merging objects wholesale [#173](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/pull/173)
* Schema breaking when generating trips from headways [#159](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/pull/159)
* Small bugs in script that adds elevation [#134](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/pull/134) & [#170](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/pull/170)

### Changed

* GeNet Scripts got a re-vamp, making them more consistent in behaviour (output folder naming and minimal outputs (usually geojsons) tracking changes made by the scripts) [#179](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/pull/179)
* Length attribute is calculated automatically, using nodes' spatial information, if not provided [#161](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/pull/161)
* Elevation Script writes the MATSim slope file [#158](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/pull/158)
* **[Breaking change]** Spatial information is now compulsory when adding new nodes [#142](https://github.com/arup-group/genet/pull/142)

## [v3.0.0] - 2022-07-14

### Added
* Addition of elevation and slope data to networks using [STRM](https://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/srtmdata/) files
* Vehicle capacity and pce scaling
  * Conveniently save multiple `vehicle.xml` files for use with simulations at different scales: 1%, 5%, 10%, etc.
* Ability to read and write additional attributes for different network and schedule elements
  * Allows you to pass any data to network links and nodes, PT schedule stops, routes and services and have it be 
  saved to the MATSim network
* Multimodal access/egress for PT stops 
  * Script to add attributes to PT stops of various PT modes that allow agents to 
  access via network or teleported modes

### Changed
* **[Breaking change]** New, **default**, representation of additional attributes
  ```python
  'attributes': {
    'osm:way:highway': 'primary' 
  }
  ```
  Instead of:
  ```python
  'attributes': {
    'osm:way:highway': {'name': 'osm:way:highway', 'class': 'java.lang.String', 'text': 'primary'}
  }
  ```
    * Crucially, this will affect methods that search for different values of OSM data, for example: find all links 
  of `highway` type `primary`, or links with particular OSM IDs. 
    * For backwards compatibility, use: `force_long_form_attributes=True` when reading the network and/or schedule 
  objects
* **[Breaking change]** folders renamed:
    * `inputs_handler` -> `input`
    * `outputs_handler` -> `output`
